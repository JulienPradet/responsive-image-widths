# Responsive Image Widths

A command-line tool helping the choice of optimal responsive image widths to put in your `srcset` attribute(s).

Run `node responsive-image-sizes.js -h`

Steps required to get the image widths list:

- Step 1: get actual contexts (viewports and screen densities) of site visitors
- Step 2: get variations of image width across viewport widths
- Step 3: compute optimal n widths from both datasets
